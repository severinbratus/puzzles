## My solution to the [Xennial Hunt](https://hunt.reaktor.com/)

Not the worst, not the best. There is a way to get a path ~600 steps shorter (I know this from the [leaderboard](https://hunt.reaktor.com/hall-of-fame)) 

For those not in the know, the third level of the Xennial Hunt features a traveling-salesman-like problem, where in order to achieve a high score, the player must collect all the 48 treasure chests (conveniently placed in 11 clusters) in a maze with 12 blocking doors and collectible keys that open those doors, and after collecting all the treasure, end the game by stepping on a particular square in the bottom-right region of the maze.

To achieve the highest score, the player must walk the shortest such path.

To add insult to injury, the program that controls the player must be written in a variant of BASIC, with line numbers on each line and all. Well, the Python script before you can indeed generate some BASIC code, to say the least.

Here is how the amazing maze looks like, in full:
